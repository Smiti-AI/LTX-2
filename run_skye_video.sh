# PROMPT_TYPE 1: Full descriptive, cinematic
PROMPT_TYPE_1='High-quality 3D animation in the style of Paw Patrol, vibrant colors, clean CGI, cinematic lighting, bright and cheerful atmosphere, smooth character animation, Nick Jr aesthetic, 4k render, detailed textures, expressive facial expressions.

Skye from Paw Patrol, the cute female cockapoo rescue puppy pilot, wearing her pink pilot goggles and pink vest, flying her small pink helicopter high in a bright blue sky with soft fluffy clouds. The helicopter gently hovers in the air while she sits in the cockpit.

Skye looks directly into the camera and talks to the viewer like a cheerful kids TV host. She speaks clearly in FIRST PERSON about her own day. She is happy, excited, and very expressive.

Dialogue (first person, speaking directly to camera):
"Hi everyone! I had such a happy day today!"
"I ate soooo many candies and sweets!"
"It was so yummy and so much fun!"
"But now I need to brush my teeth really well so they stay clean and healthy!"

She laughs, smiles, and talks energetically while sitting in the helicopter.

Camera: medium close-up inside the helicopter cockpit, Skye facing the camera.
Motion: helicopter gently hovering in the sky with soft movement.
Mood: joyful, playful, energetic children'\''s show.
Environment: bright daylight sky, soft clouds.'"$PROMPT_SUFFIX"

PROMPT_TYPE_2='High-quality 3D animation in the style of Paw Patrol, vibrant colors, clean CGI, cinematic lighting, bright cheerful atmosphere, smooth character animation, Nick Jr aesthetic, 4k render, detailed textures, expressive facial expressions.

Skye from Paw Patrol, the female cockapoo rescue puppy pilot wearing pink pilot goggles and a pink vest, sitting inside her small pink helicopter. The helicopter is hovering in a bright blue sky with soft fluffy clouds.

IMPORTANT: The entire video is ONE continuous shot. The camera angle does NOT change. No cuts, no scene transitions, no jump cuts, no camera switches.

The camera stays fixed in a stable medium close-up inside the helicopter cockpit. Skye remains centered in the frame and faces the camera the whole time. The helicopter gently hovers but the framing stays consistent.
