run_skye_benchmark.py

Auto-discovers every LoRA checkpoint across all Skye experiment output dirs
and runs all 5 benchmark scenes for each new checkpoint.

Idempotent — safe to re-run at any time.  Already-generated outputs are
skipped so this can be called after every training checkpoint.

Usage
-----
    uv run python run_skye_benchmark.py               # scan all default exp dirs
    uv run python run_skye_benchmark.py --dry-run     # print plan, generate nothing
    uv run python run_skye_benchmark.py --exp-dirs outputs/skye_exp1_baseline
    uv run python run_skye_benchmark.py --scenes bey snow   # only these scenes
